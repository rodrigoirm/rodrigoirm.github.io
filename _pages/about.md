My name is Rodrigo and I am both a master's student at Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics and a member of the [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/). Currently, I work on foundations of quantum theory under the supervision of Dr. Prof. [Marcelo Terra Cunha](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LG4eyFYAAAAJ); my research project involves studying whether there are suitable conditions for __objectivity of outcomes__ in the context of quantum Darwinism and how to connect it to Aumann's agreement theorem. \
Besides my project's themes, I am also interested on generalized probabilistic theories, quantum cryptography and I would like to understand a bit more about quantum algorithms and applications of machine learning to quantum physics.
