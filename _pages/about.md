My name is Rodrigo and I am both a master's student at Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics and a member of the [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/). Currently, I work on foundations of quantum theory under the supervision of Dr. Prof. [Marcelo Terra Cunha](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LG4eyFYAAAAJ); my research project revolves around __objectivity in physical theories__. In particular, I am working on how to extend the [quantum darwinistic](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8908) notion of objectivity of observables to generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs).  \
Besides my project's themes, I am also interested on quantum cryptography, quantum reference frames and how relativistic aspects (such as relativistic causality) play a role in quantum foundations.
