Hello there, my name is Rodrigo and I am a master's student at Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics and member of the [Mathematical Foundtaions of Quantum Theory Grou](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/). Currently, I plan to study wether there are suitable conditions for __objectivity of outcomes__ in the context of quantum Darwinism and quantum reference frames.
