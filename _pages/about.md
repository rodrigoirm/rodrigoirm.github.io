Hello there, my name is Rodrigo and I am both a master's student at Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics and a member of the [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/). Currently, under the supervision of Dr. Prof. [Marcelo Terra Cunha](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LG4eyFYAAAAJ), I plan to study whether there are suitable conditions for __objectivity of outcomes__ in the context of quantum Darwinism and quantum reference frames.
