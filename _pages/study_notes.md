Once in a while, I (try to) type up notes on topics that either: (1) I need to understand; (2) somehow I find myself interested on but aren't essential to my research or; (3) show(ed) up in courses that I am attending to (or attended to). I will try to post some of them in this page. Please, bear in mind that some of them might be a work still in progress or be incomplete. If you think I have made a mistake somewhere, feel free to discuss it with me.

[Tensor Product of Vector Spaces](https://rodrigoirm.github.io/files/notes/tensor_products.pdf)
======
Despite their ubiquitousness, during my undergraduate years, tensors were usually presented as mysterious objects $T_{j_1...j_n}^{i_1...i_m}$ that have tons of components and are characterized by the way they transform under changes of coordinate systems. To me, such presentation is a bit unsatisfying for two reasons: first, it does not define what kind of mathematical object a tensor is; second, it prevents students from getting a (fairly) simple exposition to the mathematical notion of ''taking a quotient''. In these notes, I try to carefully construct the tensor product of vector spaces and characterize it by its __universal property__.

[Generalized Probabilistic Theories (Slides)](https://rodrigoirm.github.io/files/presentations/An_Introduction_to_GPTs.pdf)
======
I presented a seminar on the basics of GPTs to my research group, here are the slides.
