Once in a while, I (try to) type up notes on topics that either: (1) I need to understand; (2) somehow I find myself interested on but aren t essential to my research or; (3) show(ed) up in courses that I am attending to(or attended to). In this page, you will find some of such notes. It might be the case that some of them are still in progress or simply incomplete.

[Tensor Product of Vector Spaces](https://rodrigoirm.github.io/files/notes/tensor_products.pdf)
======
Despite their ubiquitousness, during my undergraduate years, tensors were usually presented as mysterious objects $T_{j_1...j_n}^{i_1...i_m}$ that have tons of components and are characterized by the way they transform under changes of coordinates. To me, such presentation is a bit unsatisfying for two reasons: first, it does not define what kind of mathematical object a tensor is at all, second it prevents students from getting a (fairly) simple exposition to the notion of ''taking a quotient''. In these notes (which were written as an appendix to my GR notes), I try to carefully construct the tensor product of vector spaces and characterize it by its __universal property__.


[Notes on General Relativity](https://rodrigoirm.github.io/files/notes/gr2023_2.pdf)
======
In the current semester, I am attending a graduate-level introduction to General Relativity course. These notes are a way of keeping track with the course's content (and also expanding it a little bit). It is a work still in progress, since the course isn't finished yet.
